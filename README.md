# 🔒 Password-Based Door Locking System (Simulation)

##  Project Overview
This project simulates a **password-protected door lock system** using Arduino Uno, keypad, servo motor, and LCD display.  
The system enhances security by verifying a password entered by the user and controlling access accordingly.

##  How It Works
1. User enters a password on the keypad.  
2. The system compares input with the stored password.  
3. If correct → servo motor rotates to unlock the door and the lcd shows access granted and after 5 seconds the motor again rotates in anticlockwise direction.  
4. If incorrect → LCD displays “Access Denied”.  
5. Access status is always shown on the LCD.
